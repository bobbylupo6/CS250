To get a quality understanding of user needs, I begin by holding a meeting with the client and discussing every element that the product should be able to achieve. By doing so, I can get a generally good idea of how I want to structure the project and what priority each element has toward the whole development process. This is where user stories play a significant role in organizing what to prioritize and what exactly the task is. User stories break down each "wnt" of the client and sort them by size and priority to establish a basic layout of how the project will be worked on. 

I approach developing programs like any other sort of real-life obstacle I come about. I begin by analyzing each element of the overarching tas and break it down into workable segments. I intend to do the same with my developmental approach but incorporate the agile principles into the mix. Allowing for short-term efficient sprints that execute elements within the project at a very good pace. 

To be a good team member in software development is to be reliable and dependable. If other individuals cannot rely on someone to complete their work and communicate issues with others then they are simply not a good team member.  However, if someone shows up, completes their work, answers and asks questions, and provides updates on tasks they are assigned, they prove an incredible asset to the team.
